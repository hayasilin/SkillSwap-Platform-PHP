# SkillSwap-Platform-php

I'm a self-taught software engineer and php is the first programming language that I leared. I want to wrap up my current knowledge about php so I create this project.
This is a web platform application project which contains basic functions of being a platform that user can post there desire of swapping their skills.

This project demostrates the basic CRUD in php web application and the usage of MySQL database, which I believe will be a good example of how to use php to build a semi-social networking web for php beginners.
